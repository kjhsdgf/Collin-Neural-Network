//Class Neuron_layer
   //this will extract the data from the data file as input layer
   
     //Parameters:
     //vectors of weights and biases
     //hidden layers
            
    //Functions:
    //Read-in() which will read all the required parameters from the keyboard
    //CreateVectors() with no. of hidden layers and no. of neurons in each layer as a parameter
        //this function will create vectors for the hidden layers 
        //and, this function will create weight matrices as well
 
 //Inheritedd class: Forward Pass
    //this will assign each with the activation values and will get us the first output layer
    
      //Parameters:
      //weighted inputs for each node
      //activation values for each node
      
      //Functions:
      //Calculate_Weighted_Input() inline function which will have method to calculate the weighted input
      //Calculate_Activation_Value() inline function which will have method to calculate the Activation value
      //Assign_Weighted_inputs() 
      //Assign_Activation_Values()
      
//TBD
