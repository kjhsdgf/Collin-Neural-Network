# Priorities
## Develop question that the poster will address
### Some stuff to consider measuring, discerning against samples
- #### Efficiency growth rate
- #### "Neuronal firing" patterns
- #### Control for network architecture, vary activation function
- #### Control for activation function, vary network architecture
	- ##### Look for patterns

# After-meeting ideas
## Map a set of activations manually
- ### Note the method used, as it may inform algorithm (I don't know about using a specific method. I would suggest that networks with small topologies can be done manually to keep a track on how the patterns are changing during training)(-Ami)
## A means to interpret large sets of numbers
- ### Program GraphViz tool to output
	- ### [draw a neural network through graphviz - zhu45](http://zhu45.org/posts/2017/May/25/draw-a-neural-network-through-graphviz/)
