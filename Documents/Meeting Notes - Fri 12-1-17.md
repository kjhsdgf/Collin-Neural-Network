# Ideas about making the poster:
### The general syntax according to Ami, would be:
					Topic ("Classifying Data Using Neural Networks" -Ami)
			Abstract
			Section 1: Introduction 
			Section 2: Architecture of a Neural Network
			Section 3: How a Neural Network works?
					3.1 Choosing Hyperparamters for training algorithm
					3.2 Forward Propagation Algorithm
						3.2.1 Role of Activation Function in a Neural Network
					3.3 Cost Function
					3.4 Back Propagation Algorithm
						3.4.1 Learning by Stochastic Gradient Descent
						3.4.2 Error calculation by using matrices
			Section 4: Optimizing the Efficiency of Neural Networks
			Section 5: Results
			Section 6: Conclusion
			Citations
			
### Apart from this, some important stuff to do:
#### -Cleaning up extra stuff from the Network class
#### -Updating Documentation.md (if all of us agrees)
