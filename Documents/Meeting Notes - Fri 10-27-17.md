# Priorities
## 1. Improve network efficiency
- ### this means loading into a data structure and doing operations that way
- ### additionally, make as many functions/members `inline`, `static`, and/or `const` as possible
## 2. Work in some sort of visualization as output
- ### may be tough to implement from the ground-up, may also require that we write a new class for all this biz (if we go that route)
- ### Here are some existing assets, for inspiration or to use in a crunch
	- #### [NGraph](http://math.nist.gov/~RPozo/ngraph/ngraph_index.html)
	- #### [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/snap/)
	- #### [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/)
	- #### [StackExchange, coding and printing a graph](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/36464/coding-and-printing-a-graph)
## 3. Use MNIST dataset as training input to train the network 

# Additional Tips from Slater
## 1. Use argv[0] to do file navigation! It contains the entire filepath!

# Please add any notes that you took during the meeting!
