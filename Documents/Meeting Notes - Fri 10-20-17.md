# Priorities
## 1. State machine for activation function defaults (and their derivatives) <-- any need to make one for cost functions?
## 2. Converting file operations to work in binary mode
## 3. Pseudocode for the "wrapper" functions
### * Need to know how they'll work to inform conversion of Network class to a class template
## 4. Getting a `main()` with `argc` and `argv[]` that can be run from console
## 5. Think super hard about implementation of thresholds into `ambiguousData()`
### * What is ambiguous data? How much should we hard code into the class?

This is from memory, so edit as your personal notes reflect. [~Eli]
