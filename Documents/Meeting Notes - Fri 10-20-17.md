# Priorities
## 1. State machine for activation function defaults (and their derivatives) <-- any need to make one for cost functions?
 I think yes! Definitely, we should make one for the cost functions too. (-Ami)
## 2. Converting file operations to work in binary mode
## 3. Pseudocode for the "wrapper" functions
### * Need to know how they'll work to inform conversion of Network class to a class template
## 4. Getting a `main()` with `argc` and `argv[]` that can be run from console
## 5. Think super hard about implementation of thresholds into `ambiguousData()`
### * What is ambiguous data? How much should we hard code into the class?
## 6. Coding a GUI for the classes 
### *Writing a function by which a user can easily set up the directory for visual studio to acces the files*

This is from memory, so edit as your personal notes reflect. [~Eli]
